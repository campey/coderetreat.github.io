The **Saturday, October 22nd** is getting closer and with it the Global Day of Coderetreat 2016. It's now the time to consider how you'll participate in the event. Here are the possibilities:

You can **participate** in a local coderetreat and freeing yourself to experiment and try new techniques, learning from each other, writing the best code you can by focusing on some basic principles of well-written code and challenging many of our everyday assumption. Interested? Information about local events will be published on the [GDCR Website](http://gdcr.coderetreat.org/){:target="_blank"} and the   [coderetreat.org events section](http://archive.coderetreat.org/events/event/listByType?type=gdcr16){:target="_self"}.

You want to help others enjoy GDCR and raise the bar in our industry? You should organize a local event.

You can **host** a coderetreat of your own in your city. Hosts handle all of the logistics of organizing, finding
a local sponsor, running a coderetreat and creating an atmosphere of fun and collaboration. Don't worry if you haven't hosted a coderetreat yet. We are here to support you and we will provide you many resources to help you organize an amazing
event. If you are interested in hosting a coderetreat in your city for GDCR 2016, please submit [this form](http://goo.gl/forms/Px0ytk6ZS7ZQAdew1){:target="_blank"} and we will add you to the facilitator/host mailing lists where you
can get help from other facilitators and hosts from around the world.

Every coderetreat needs a **facilitator** as well. Facilitators guide participants through the exercises and lead the retrospectives. Don't worry if you haven't facilitated a coderetreat yet. We are here to support you! We will provide you with resources and online training sessions. If you are interested in facilitating a coderetreat event in your city for GDCR 2016, please submit [this form](http://goo.gl/forms/Px0ytk6ZS7ZQAdew1){:target="_blank"} and we will add you to the facilitator/host mailing lists where you can get help from other facilitators and hosts from around the world.

There is also a [#gdcr channel](https://softwarecraftsmanship.slack.com/messages/gdcr/){:target="_blank"} at [Software Craftsmanship Slack](http://slack.softwarecraftsmanship.org/){:target="_blank"} where you can ask for help and advice and in general discuss anything related to GDCR.

We hope you are looking forward to GDCR 2016 as much as we are. :)
